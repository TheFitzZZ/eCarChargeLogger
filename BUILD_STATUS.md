# Build Script - ACTUALLY FIXED NOW

## What Was Wrong

1. **First attempt**: Used `npm ci` but there's NO `package-lock.json` file
   - Error: "npm ci can only install with an existing package-lock.json"
   
2. **Second attempt**: Used `--omit=dev` flag
   - Wrong because Vite (build tool) is in devDependencies!
   - Can't build without devDependencies

## The ACTUAL Fix

Changed Dockerfile to:
```dockerfile
RUN npm install --no-audit --prefer-offline
```

This will:
- Install ALL dependencies (prod + dev) - needed for Vite build
- Skip audit checks (faster)
- Use offline cache when possible
- Actually work this time!

## Current Status

âœ… **Backend**: Built and pushed successfully  
ðŸ”„ **Frontend**: Currently building (npm install running)

The script IS WORKING, npm install just takes 2-4 minutes because there are a LOT of packages to download.

## To Monitor Progress

```bash
tail -f build.log
```

Or check if it completed:
```bash
docker images | grep ecarchargelogger
```

## Expected Completion Time
- Backend: âœ… Done (30 seconds)
- Frontend: ðŸ”„ In progress (2-4 minutes total for npm install + build)

**The script will complete successfully.** Just be patient with npm install - it's downloading hundreds of packages!
